# Kaggle Titanic Challenge Code
This repository is sample code for exploring the Kaggle Titanic challenge. Many have paved this knowledge path before me and I hope to learn from their experience. I started this challenge several months ago by searching for knowledge of the people that have traveled this path before, but I got distracted with NiFi and a cyber classification project. This repository will capture my learning experience. I give many thanks to those that have shared their approaches.
